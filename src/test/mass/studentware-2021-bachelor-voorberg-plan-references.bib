abstract = {Java performance is far from being trivial to benchmark because it is affected by various factors such as the Java application, its input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size, etc. In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution time of a Java program to differ from run to run. There are a number of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timer-based method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various system effects. There exist a wide variety of Java performance evaluation methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These methodologies differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report average performance over a number of runs of the same experiment; others report the best or second best performance observed; yet others report the worst. Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM invocation; others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate a single benchmark execution; yet others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate the benchmark multiple times. This paper shows that prevalent methodologies can be misleading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions. The reason is that the data analysis is not statistically rigorous. In this paper, we present a survey of existing Java performance evaluation methodologies and discuss the importance of statistically rigorous data analysis for dealing with non-determinism. We advocate approaches to quantify startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in addition, we provide the JavaStats software to automatically obtain performance numbers in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses on Java performance evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this paper also apply to other programming languages and systems that build on a managed runtime system.

abstract = {The splay tree, a self-adjusting form of binary search tree, is developed and analyzed. The binary search tree is a data structure for representing tables and lists so that accessing, inserting, and deleting items is easy. On an n-node splay tree, all the standard search tree operations have an amortized time bound of O(log n) per operation, where by “amortized time” is meant the time per operation averaged over a worst-case sequence of operations. Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient, to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiency of splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying, whenever the tree is accessed. Extensions of splaying give simplified forms of two other data structures: lexicographic or multidimensional search trees and link/cut trees. {\textcopyright} 1985, ACM. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to “catch” the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time. {\textcopyright} 1970, ACM.

We show several deterministic upper bounds for the case when the number of bit probes, is small, by explicit constructions, culminating in one that uses o(m) bits of space where membership can be determined with [lg lg n] + 2 adaptive bit probes.
