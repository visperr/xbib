  abstract =	 { Standard ML (SML) has been used to implement a wide
                  variety of large systems, such as compilers, theorem
                  provers, graphics libraries, and even operating
                  systems. While SML provides a convenient, high-level
                  notation for programming large applications, it does
                  have certain deficiencies. One such deficiency is
                  the lack of a general mechanism for assigning
                  symbolic names to constant values. In this paper, we
                  present a simple extension of SML that corrects this
                  deficiency in a way that fits naturally with the
                  semantics of SML. Our proposal is a generalization
                  of SML's datatype constructors: we introduce {\em
                  constants} that generalize nullary datatype
                  constructors (like \texttt{nil}), and {\em
                  templates} that generalize non-nullary datatype
                  constructors (like \texttt{::}). Constants are
                  identifiers bound to fixed values, and templates are
                  identifiers bound to structured values with labeled
                  holes. Templates are useful because they allow users
                  to treat the representation of structured data
                  abstractly without having to give up pattern
                  matching. },

                  a set of related products that share more
                  commonalities than variabilities. Feature models are
                  widely used for variability and commonality
                  management in software product lines. Feature models
                  are information models where a set of products are
                  represented as a set of features in a single model.
                  The automated analysis of feature models deals with
                  the computer-aided extraction of information from
                  feature models. The literature on this topic has
                  contributed with a set of operations, techniques,
                  tools and empirical results which have not been
                  surveyed until now. This paper provides a
                  comprehensive literature review on the automated
                  analysis of feature models 20 years after of their
                  invention. This paper contributes by bringing
                  together previously disparate streams of work to
                  help shed light on this thriving area. We also
                  present a conceptual framework to understand the
                  different proposals as well as categorise future
                  contributions. We finally discuss the different
                  studies and propose some challenges to be faced in
                  the future. "

  abstract =	 {We define a translation from an intermediate box
                  language for pretty printing to \TeX. This
                  translation can be used as a back-end for pretty
                  printers in documentation tools for programming
                  languages. The translation is formulated in an
                  executable algebraic specification formalism. An
                  important aspect of the translation is the
                  transformation of boxes according to a set of
                  equations. These equations preserve the text
                  formatting semantics of boxes which is also defined
                  algebraically. New in this approach is that
                  algebraic transformations of box terms are used to
                  circumvent the limitations of the typesetter.\par
                  The \TeX\ generator, which translates the box
                  language to \TeX\ code, is a component of
                  documentation tools generated for the programming
                  environments developed with the ASF+SDF
                  meta-environment, but can also be used as a separate
                  tool. As a case study, the construction of a
                  typesetter for the process specification formalism
                  PSF is shown.},

abstract = "This chapter discusses that the application of methods of statistical analysis and statistical mechanics to the problem of turbulent fluid motion has attracted much attention in recent years. It investigated a complicated system of nonlinear equations, in order to find out enough about the properties of the solutions of these equations that insight can be obtained into the various patterns exhibited by the field and that data can be derived concerning the relative frequencies of these patterns in the hope that in this way a basis may be found for the calculation of important values. The difficulties encounter are of a twofold nature: in part they are connected with the complicated geometrical character of the hydrodynamical equations; in part they are dependent upon the presence of nonlinear terms, containing derivatives of the first order of the velocity components, along with derivatives of the second order multiplied by the very small coefficient of viscosity. The latter feature is responsible for a number of important, characteristics of turbulence, among which are prominent those connected with the balance of energy and with the appearance of dissipation layers. These layer an important part in the energy exchange, as they represent the main regions where energy is dissipated."

                  whereas GP leads to more efficient programs by
                  avoiding dynamic typing. This paper presents SCOOP,
                  a new paradigm which enables both classical OO
                  design and high performance in {C++} by mixing OOP
                  and GP. We show how classical and advanced OO
                  features such as virtual methods, multiple
                  inheritance, argument covariance, virtual types and
                  multimethods can be implemented in a fully
                  statically typed model, hence without run-time

                  {C++} to express shared memory parallelism. It
                  leaves the base language unspecified, and vendors
                  can implement OpenMP in any Fortran compiler.
                  Naturally, to support pointers and allocatables,
                  Fortran 90 and Fortran 95 require the OpenMP
                  implementation to include additional semantics over
                  Fortran 77. OpenMP leverages many of the X3H5
                  concepts while extending them to support coarse
                  grain parallelism. The standard also includes a

                  engineering tools, powerful language-generic
                  program-transformation components are needed. We
                  propose the use of attribute grammars (AGs) to
                  generate language specific disambiguation filters.
                  In this paper, a complete implementation of a
                  language-independent AGs system is presented. As a
                  full scale experiment, we present an implementation
                  of a flexible C front-end. Its specifications are
                  concise, modular, and the result is efficient. On
                  top of it, transformations such as software
                  renovation, code metrics, domain specific language
                  embedding can be implemented.},

                  disambiguation based on Attribute Grammars (AGs).
                  AGs share the same modularity model as its host
                  grammar language, here Syntax Definition Formalism
                  (SDF), what makes them particularly attractive for
                  working on unstable grammars, or grammar extensions.
                  The framework we propose is effective, since a full
                  ISO-C99 disambiguation chain already works, and the
                  core of the hardest ambiguities of {C++} is solved.
                  This requires specific techniques, and some
                  extensions to the stock AG model.}

                  program in compilers and language processing tools.
                  Many of the tasks of these tools consist in
                  generating and rewriting ASTs. Such an approach can
                  become tedious and hard to maintain for complex
                  operations, namely program transformation,
                  optimization, instrumentation, etc. On the other
                  hand, \emph{concrete syntax} provides a natural and
                  simpler representation of programs, but it is not
                  usually available as a direct feature of the
                  aforementioned tools. We propose a simple technique
                  to implement AST generation and rewriting in general
                  purpose languages using concrete syntax. Our
                  approach relies on extensions made in the scanner
                  and the parser and the use of objects supporting
                  partial parsing called Text With Embedded Abstract
                  Syntax Trees (TWEASTS). A compiler for a simple
                  language (Tiger) written in \Cxx serves as an
                  example, featuring transformations in concrete
                  syntax: syntactic desugaring, optimization, code
                  instrumentation such as bounds-checking, etc.
                  Extensions of this technique to provide a
                  full-fledged concrete-syntax rewriting framework are
                  presented as well.}

                  write disambiguation filters for \acs{sdf} grammars:
                  algebraic equations with \acs{asf}, rewrite-rules
                  with programmable traversals for \stratego, and
                  attribute grammars with \acr{tag}, our system. To
                  this end we introduce \phenix, a highly ambiguous
                  language. Its ``standard'' grammar exhibits
                  ambiguities inspired by those found in the \C and
                  \Cxx standard grammars. To evaluate modularity, the
                  grammar is layered: it starts with a small core
                  language, and several layers add new features, new
                  production rules, and new ambiguities.},

                  and designing image processing chains in which each
                  processing is a component. But since there exist
                  many image types (different structures such as 2D
                  images, 3D images or graphs, as well as different
                  value types) the platform has been designed with
                  genericity and reusability in mind: each component
                  is written as a generic {C++} procedure, \`a la STL.
                  Other libraries, such as Khoros [Kon94] have a
                  different approach where a processing component
                  contains an implementation for each type supported
                  by the library. This makes code maintenance hard and
                  prevents easy addition of new image types. Still,
                  Olena is not only a generic component library
                  [Jaz95], it shall contain additional tools such as a
                  visual programming environment (VPE). Those tools
                  may be programmed in a classical object-oriented
                  fashion (using operation and inclusion polymorphism)
                  which may seems antagonist with the generic
                  programming paradigm used in the library. Section 2
                  outlines the architecture of Olena and elaborates
                  more on the design problems resulting from the use
                  of generic components. Section 3 presents the
                  solution chosen to address these problems.}

  abstract =	 {Generic programming is a paradigm whose wide
                  adoption by the {C++} community is quite recent. In
                  this approach most classes and procedures are
                  parameterized, leading to the construction of
                  general and efficient software components. In this
                  paper, we show how some design patterns from Gamma
                  et al. can be adapted to this paradigm. Although
                  these patterns rely highly on dynamic binding. We
                  show that, by making intensive use of parametric
                  polymorphism in the context of generic programming,
                  the method calls in these patterns can be resolved
                  at compile-time. The speed-up achieved using these
                  patterns is significant.}

  abstract =	 {Refactoring is about improving the design of
                  existing code. It is the process of changing a
                  software system in such a way that it does not alter
                  the external behavior of the code, yet improves its
                  internal structure. With refactoring you can even
                  take a bad design and rework it into a good one.
                  This book offers a thorough discussion of the
                  principles of refactoring, including where to spot
                  opportunities for refactoring, and how to set up the
                  required tests. There is also a catalog of more than
                  40 proven refactorings with details as to when and
                  why to use the refactoring, step by step
                  instructions for implementing it, and an example
                  illustrating how it works The book is written using
                  Java as its principle language, but the ideas are
                  applicable to any OO language.},

                  of applications. Yet, to our knowledge, their use to
                  disambiguate is novel. We present our implementation
                  of an evaluator of attributes for ambiguous AGs,
                  tailored to ambiguous parse trees disambiguation.
                  This paper focuses on its implementation that
                  heavily relies on Stratego/XT, which is also used as
                  language to express the attribute rules. A companion
                  paper presents the disambiguation process in details

abstract={A mathematical data model for scientific visualization that is based on the mathematics of fiber bundles is presented. Previous results are extended to the case of piecewise field representations (associated with grid-based data representations), and a general mathematical model for piecewise representations of fields on irregular grids is presented. The various types of regularity that can be found in computational grids and techniques for compact field representation based on each form of regularity are discussed. These techniques can be combined to obtain efficient methods for representing fields on grids with various regular or partially regular structures},

  abstract =	 {An ambiguous context-free grammar defines a language
                  in which some sentences have multiple
                  interpretations. For conciseness, ambiguous
                  context-free grammars are frequently used to define
                  even completely unambiguous languages and numerous
                  disambiguation methods exist for specifying which
                  interpretation is the intended one for each
                  sentence. The existing methods can be divided in
                  `parser specific' methods that describe how some
                  parsing technique deals with ambiguous sentences and
                  `logical' methods that describe the intended
                  interpretation without reference to a specific
                  parsing technique. We propose a framework of {\em
                  filters\/} to describe and compare a wide range of
                  disambiguation problems in a parser-independent way.
                  A filter is a function that selects from a set of
                  parse trees (the canonical representation of the
                  interpretations of a sentence) the intended trees.
                  The framework enables us to define several general
                  properties of disambiguation methods. The expressive
                  power of filters is illustrated by several case
                  studies. Finally, a start is made with the study of
                  efficient implementation techniques for filters by
                  exploiting the commutativity of parsing steps and
                  filter steps for certain classes of filters.},

                  Formalism (SDF) seems to be extensible: the user is
                  tempted to tailor its grammar syntax by adding new
                  annotation kinds. Unfortunately the standard SDF
                  crunching tools from Stratego/XT do not support the
                  extension of SDF, and the user has to develop the
                  whole set of tools for her home grown extension(s).
                  We present the SDF tool set that provides ``weak''
                  genericity with respect to the grammar grammar:
                  support for arbitrary SDF annotations. We would like
                  to contribute it to Stratego/XT since its components
                  subsume their stock peers. Finally, we present a set

  abstract =	 {A formalism for constructing and using axiomatic
                  specifications in an arbitrary logical system is
                  presented. This builds on the framework provided by
                  Goguen and Burstall's work on the notion of an
                  \emph{institution} as a formalisation of the concept
                  of a logical system for writing specifications. We
                  show how to introduce free variables into the
                  sentences of an arbitrary institution and how to add
                  quantifiers which bind them. We use this foundation
                  to define a set of primitive operations for building
                  specifications in an arbitrary institution based
                  loosely on those in the ASL kernel specification
                  language. We examine the set of operations which
                  results when the definitions are instantiated in
                  institutions of total and partial first-order logic
                  and compare these with the operations found in
                  existing specification languages. We present proof
                  rules which allow proofs to be conducted in
                  specifications built using the operations we define.
                  Finally, we introduce a simple mechanism for
                  defining and applying parameterised specifications
                  and briefly discuss the program development
                  process.},

                  present a proposal for an XML format that allows

                  Several simple image processing algorithms are used
                  to evaluate the performance of pixel access and
                  arithmetic operations in both languages. We
                  demonstrate that the behavior of equivalent Lisp and
                  C code is similar with respect to the choice of data
                  structures and types, and also to external
                  parameters such as hardware optimization. We further
                  demonstrate that properly typed and optimized Lisp
                  code runs as fast as the equivalent C code, or even
                  faster in some cases.}

                  domain-specific languages (DSLs) are usually very
                  different from general purpose programming languages
                  (GPLs), both at the syntactic and the semantic
                  levels. One approach to DSL implementation is to
                  write a full language infrastructure, including
                  parser, interpreter or even compiler. Another
                  approach however, is to ground the DSL into an
                  extensible GPL, giving you control over its own
                  syntax and semantics. The DSL may then be designed
                  merely as an \emph{extension} to the original GPL,
                  and its implementation may boil down to expressing
                  only the differences with it. The task of DSL
                  implementation is hence considerably eased. The
                  purpose of this chapter is to provide a tour of the
                  features that make a GPL extensible, and to
                  demonstrate how, in this context, the distinction
                  between DSL and GPL can blur, sometimes to the point
                  of complete disappearance.}

                  formalism as a family of formalisms. Starting with a
                  small kernel, several features for syntax definition
                  are designed orthogonally to each other. This
                  provides a framework for constructing new formalisms
                  by adapting and extending old ones. The formalism is
                  developed with the algebraic specification formalism
                  ASF+SDF. It provides the following features: lexical
                  and context-free syntax, variables, disambiguation
                  by priorities, regular expressions, character
                  classes and modular definitions. New are the uniform
                  treatment of lexical syntax, context-free syntax and
                  variables, the treatment of regular expressions by
                  normalization yielding abstract syntax without
                  auxiliary sorts, regular expressions as result of
                  productions and modules with hidden imports and
                  renamings.},

  abstract =	 {Context-free grammars are used in several algebraic
                  specification formalisms instead of first-order
                  signatures for the definition of the structure of
                  algebras, because grammars provide better notation
                  than signatures. The rigidity of these first-order
                  structures enforces a choice between strongly typed
                  structures with little genericity or generic
                  operations over untyped structures. In two-level
                  signatures the second level defines the algebra of
                  types used at the first level. Two-level grammars
                  are the grammatical counterpart of two-level
                  signatures. This paper discusses the correspondence
                  between context-free grammars and first-order
                  signatures, the extension of these to two-level
                  grammars and signatures and shows how two-level
                  grammars can be used for polymorphic syntax
                  definition and the problems there are for the usage
                  of two-level grammars as signatures in algebraic
                  specification formalisms.},

                  program transformation based on rewriting
                  strategies. The Stratego compiler is based on
                  program transformation; it transforms a high-level
                  Stratego specification via several intermediate
                  representations to C. Several optimizations are
                  performed on the intermediate representations. The
                  compiler is bootstrapped, i.e., it is specified in

                  the compilation of strategies; some high-lights of
                  the specification; and experience with using
                  strategies for writing program transformations.},
