    abstract = {Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language widely used in contemporary web applications for defining the presentation semantics of web documents. Despite its relatively simple syntax, the language has a number of complex features like inheritance, cascading and specificity, which make CSS code challenging to understand and maintain. It has been noted in prior research that CSS code is prone to contain code smells which indicate design weaknesses and maintainability issues. In this paper we focus on one of those code smells called undoing style. It happens when a property is set to a value A, then overridden to another value B, possibly multiple times, and then set back to the original value of A. We refer to this pattern as the A?B*A pattern. We propose a technique that detects undoing style in CSS code and recommends refactoring opportunities to eliminate instances of undoing style while preserving the semantics of the web application. We evaluate our technique on 41 real-world web applications, and outline a proof of correctness for our refactoring. Our findings show that undoing style is quite prominent in CSS code. Additionally, there are many refactorings that can be applied while hardly introducing any errors.},
