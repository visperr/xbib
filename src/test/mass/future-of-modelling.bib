abstract="The limited adoption of Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is due to a variety of social and technical factors, which can be summarized in one: its (real or perceived) benefits do not outweigh its costs. In this vision paper we argue that the cognification of MDSE has the potential to reverse this situation. Cognification is the application of knowledge (inferred from large volumes of information, artificial intelligence or collective intelligence) to boost the performance and impact of a process. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of cognifying MDSE tasks and we describe some potential scenarios where cognification can bring quantifiable and perceivable advantages. And conversely, we also discuss how MDSE techniques themselves can help in the improvement of AI, Machine learning, bot generation and other cognification techniques.",

	abstract = {Context: The OutSystems Platform is a development environment composed of several DSLs, used to specify, quickly build and validate web and mobile applications. The DSLs allow users to model different perspectives such as interfaces and data models, define custom business logic and construct process models. Problem: The DSL for process modelling (Business Process Technology (BPT)), has a low adoption rate and is perceived as having usability problems hampering its adoption. This is problematic given the language maintenance costs. Method: We used a combination of interviews, a critical review of BPT using the “Physics of Notation” and empirical evaluations of BPT using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the NASA Task Load indeX (TLX), to develop a new version of BPT, taking these inputs and Outsystems’ engineers culture into account. Results: Evaluations conducted with 25 professional software engineers showed an increase of the semantic transparency on the new version, from 31\% to 69\%, an increase in the correctness of responses, from 51\% to 89\%, an increase in the SUS score, from 42.25 to 64.78, and a decrease of the TLX score, from 36.50 to 20.78. These differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: These results suggest the new version of BPT significantly improved the developer experience of the previous version. The end users background with OutSystems had a relevant impact on the final concrete syntax choices and achieved usability indicators.},

	abstract = {Currently, enterprises have to make quick and resilient responses to changing market requirements. In light of this, low-code development platforms provide the technology mechanisms to facilitate and automate the development of software applications to support current enterprise needs and promote digital transformation. Based on a theory-building research methodology through the literature and other information sources review, the main contribution of this paper is the current characterisation of the emerging low-code domain following the foundations of the computer-aided software engineering ﬁeld. A context analysis, focused on the current status of research related to the low-code development platforms, is performed. Moreover, benchmarking among the existing low-code development platforms addressed to manufacturing industry is analysed to identify the current lacking features. As an illustrative example of the emerging low-code paradigm and respond to the identiﬁed uncovered features, the virtual factory open operating system (vf-OS) platform is described as an open multi-sided low-code framework able to manage the overall network of a collaborative manufacturing and logistics environment that enables humans, applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to seamlessly communicate and interoperate in the interconnected environment, promoting resilient digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Knowledge Workers have to deal with lots of different information systems to support daily work. This assumption leads to massive gaps in companies based on the complexity of legacy systems on one hand side and the development of the business processes on the other hand side. Many knowledge workers build their own shadow IT to get efficient process support without thinking about compliance, security, and scalability. One possible solution to deactivate this situation might be the idea of LowCode/NoCode platforms. The question is: Will knowledge workers be using this technology or are they not accepting the new trend? Therefore, the authors conducted a quantitative study based on an online questionnaire (N = 106) to check the acceptance of this upcoming technology for companies in the DACH region. The result of the study is a statement about the future willingness to use.},
