    abstract = {Most methods for biological sequence homology search and alignment work with primary sequence alone, neglecting higher-order correlations. Recently, statistical physics models called Potts models have been used to infer all-by-all pairwise correlations between sites in deep multiple sequence alignments, and these pairwise couplings have improved 3D structure predictions. Here we extend the use of Potts models from structure prediction to sequence alignment and homology search by developing what we call a hidden Potts model (HPM) that merges a Potts emission process to a generative probability model of insertion and deletion. Because an HPM is incompatible with efficient dynamic programming alignment algorithms, we develop an approximate algorithm based on importance sampling, using simpler probabilistic models as proposal distributions. We test an HPM implementation on RNA structure homology search benchmarks, where we can compare directly to exact alignment methods that capture nested RNA base-pairing correlations (stochastic context-free grammars). HPMs perform promisingly in these proof of principle experiments.},

abstract = {Algorithmic generation of data, known as procedural content generation, is an attractive prospect within the game development industry as a means of creating infinitely fresh and varied content. In this paper, we present an approach to level generation for roguelike dungeon style levels, based on our examination of the suite of existing approaches used in formal research. Our generator aims to create simple dungeon style level layouts that are always playable. We utilise a hybrid technique combining context free grammars to generate a description of levels and a cellular automata inspired process to generate the physical space. The generator proves successful at consistently generating dungeon layouts that maintain completability at all times with sufficient variation, when accounting for the occasional need for corrective actions. We conclude that there is substantial value in hybrid approaches to automated level design and propose a new heuristic by which to assess dungeon style level content.},

abstract = {Grammar-based procedural level generation raises the productivity of level designers for games such as dungeon crawl and platform games. However, the improved productivity comes at cost of level quality assurance. Authoring, improving and maintaining grammars is difficult because it is hard to predict how each grammar rule impacts the overall level quality, and tool support is lacking. We propose a novel metric called Metric of Added Detail (MAD) that indicates if a rule adds or removes detail with respect to its phase in the transformation pipeline, and Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) for expressing level properties and analyzing how qualities evolve in level generation histories. We demonstrate MAD and SAnR using a prototype of a level generator called Ludoscope Lite. Our preliminary results show that problematic rules tend to break SAnR properties and that MAD intuitively raises flags. MAD and SAnR augment existing approaches, and can ultimately help designers make better levels and level generators.},

abstract = {Formal grammars are widely used in speech recognition, language translation, and language understanding systems. Grammars rich enough to accommodate natural language generate multiple interpretations of typical sentences. These ambiguities are a fundamental challenge to practical application. Grammars can be equipped with probability distributions, and the various parameters of these distributions can be estimated from data (e.g., acoustic representations of spoken words or a corpus of hand-parsed sentences). The resulting probabilistic grammars help to interpret spoken or written language unambiguously. This article reviews the main classes of probabilistic grammars and points to some active areas of research.}

abstract="Narrative puzzles involve exploration, logical thinking and progressing a story. This paper presents a narrative design innovation in the form of a system for the procedural generation of such puzzles for use in story-rich games or games with large open worlds. The approach uses an extended type of context-free grammar as the basis for both the generation algorithm and the puzzle solving. Each designer-defined rule in the grammar defines a possible behavior of item types in the game world. Puzzles are generated at runtime on a per area basis, through recursive generation of inputs for outputs. Given a valid grammar, the system guarantees that its puzzles are solvable.",
