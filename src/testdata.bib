    (1997) in support of his metalinguistic or quotation theory of
    proper names, according to which a name N means the individual
    named N. The data illustrate ten linguistic behaviours claimed to
    be shared by proper names and definite descriptions.  I argue
    that in some cases the behaviours have a common explanation which
    is based on a property independent of Geurts' analysis, and that
    in the remaining cases the behaviours are not actually shared.
    Thus these behaviours do not actually support the metalinguistic
    theory.      },
